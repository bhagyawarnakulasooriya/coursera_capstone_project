    "Politics is a blend of the government, political parties and the politicians of a country. In Australia, the political discourse has an apperent influence on the life of people, including immigration, cost of housing, the freedom and rights of an individual and many more.  \n",

    "As stated by Winston Churchill, \"Politics is not a game, but a serious business\". Political parties have both long term and short term plans, when preparing for their propaganda. They consider various factors such as average income per person, religion distribution, employment distribution, natural resources distribution,  in each area for an insightful planning. They take the advantage of each factor when appointing candidates for an area, organizing meetings, workshops, other volunteer work etc. \n",

    "Data cleaning was done at first. The towns with zero population was removed from the dataframe. Since only the suburbs were considered, the towns which falls under suburbs were filtered out of the dataframe which led to a total of 127. All the suburb towns were fallen under eight states, namely, Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Northern Territory.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The latitude and longitude coordinate of each town was readily available in the dataframe and the basic need was to grab only the name of the town and its corresponding coordinates. But I could not opt out the state which each town belongs to, because there were towns which had the same name, but falls under different states. Although these types of towns have different geographical coordinates, for later coding purposes, continuing with both the name and the state was convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium was used to map the suburb towns. While itereting through the dataframe, the GET requests were made to Foursqaure in order to get only the religious venue categories around each suburb town. The religious venue categories of each town was fed into a another dataframe along with their venue name, venue latitude and venue longitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/imgs/venue_category_table.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, this dataframe contained venue categories which are not religious venues. This is because when we are considering the latitude and longitude of a specific point, foursquare may capture many venue categories.\n",
    "For example a building could have a church at the ground floor while having a restaurant in an upper floor. So I had to filter only the religious venues from the foursquare json results for each town.\n",

    "One hot encoding was used. The number of venues which falls under a specific venue category for each town was counted. \n",

    "Popular machine learning technique, K-Means Clustering was used to cluster the suburb towns based on their religious venue distribution. Here the optimal value for K was found using the elbow method and it turned out to be 3. \n",

    "By the way, the majority of every cluster is possesed by the christians/catholics. So the distribution of each cluster excluding the churches would account to a more clear picture about the minor religion disrtibution.\n",

Pretty much Jewish are here compared to cluster 0 which become the second most religion of this cluster. Third comes the Hindus together with 7% of venues(Hindu Temples and Shrines) for their religion. The least contribution is by Buddhists.\n",

    "In this study, the suburb towns of Australia were categorized into three clusters depending on the religious venue distribution of each town using 'K-Means Clustering'. The venue distribution of each cluster was then considered and used to predict the religion distribution of the three clusters. Thus, a political party could have an idea about the religion distribution of each town by figuring out, which cluster this town belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "I reccomend that a political party would consider each cluster with Christian/catholic as the top most religion and the Islam being the second while the minority being multi-religions in cluster 0, more Jews and Hindus in cluster 1 and Jews and Buddists in cluster 2. By the way, a political party could organize similar campaigns in towns which belongs to the same cluster and consider the religion distribution of each town to make important dicisions in their future endeavors."
